### A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
```TSQL
SELECT 
	s.*,
	p.plan_name,
	p.price
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19);
```
| customer_id | plan_id | start_date | plan_name     | price   |
|-------------|---------|------------|---------------|---------|
| 1           | 0       | 2020-08-01 | trial         | 0.00    |
| 1           | 1       | 2020-08-08 | basic monthly | 9.90    |

WHERE YEAR(s.start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY YEAR(s.start_date), p.plan_name;
```
| events | plan_name     | counts  |
|--------|---------------|---------|

    / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churn_pct
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p 
  ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id;
```
| churn_count | churn_pct   |
|-------------|-------------|

  100*COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions) AS pct
FROM nextPlan
WHERE plan_name = 'trial' 
  AND next_plan = 'churn';
```
| churn_after_trial | pct         |

)

SELECT 
  plan_id,
  plan_name,
  COUNT(*) AS customers,
  CAST(100*COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) 
      / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions) AS conversion_rate
FROM plansDate
WHERE (next_date IS NOT NULL AND (start_date < '2020-12-31' AND next_date > '2020-12-31'))
  OR (next_date IS NULL AND start_date < '2020-12-31')
GROUP BY plan_id, plan_name

```
| plan_id | plan_name     | customers | conversion_rate  |
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| 0       | trial         | 19        | 1.9              |
| 1       | basic monthly | 224       | 22.4             |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 326       | 32.6             |

SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE p.plan_name = 'pro annual'
  AND YEAR(s.start_date) = 2020;
```
| customer_count  |
|-----------------|
| 195             |

---
### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
```TSQL
WITH trialPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS trial_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'trial'
),
annualPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS annual_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'pro annual'
)

SELECT 
  AVG(CAST(DATEDIFF(d, trial_date, annual_date) AS FLOAT)) AS avg_days_to_annual
FROM trialPlan t
JOIN annualPlan a 
ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id;
```
| avg_days_to_annual  |
|---------------------|
| 104.62015503876     |

On average, it takes 105 days for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi.

---
### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)?
To solve this question: 
* Utilize 2 CTEs in the previous question: ```trialPlan``` and ```annualPlan``` to calculate the number of days between ```trial_date``` and ```annual_date```, then put that to new CTE named ```datesDiff```
* Create a recursive CTE named ```daysRecursion``` to generate 30-day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
* Left join from ```daysRecursion``` to ```datesDiff``` 
    
```TSQL
WITH trialPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS trial_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'trial'
),
annualPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date AS annual_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE p.plan_name = 'pro annual'
),
datesDiff AS (
  SELECT 
    t.customer_id,
    DATEDIFF(d, trial_date, annual_date) AS diff
  FROM trialPlan t
  JOIN annualPlan a ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id
),
daysRecursion AS (
  SELECT 
    0 AS start_period, 
    30 AS end_period
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    end_period + 1 AS start_period,
    end_period + 30 AS end_period
  FROM daysRecursion
  WHERE end_period < 360
)

SELECT 
  dr.start_period,
  dr.end_period,
  COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM daysRecursion dr
LEFT JOIN datesDiff dd 
  ON (dd.diff >= dr.start_period AND dd.diff <= dr.end_period)
GROUP BY dr.start_period, dr.end_period;
```
| start_period | end_period | customer_count  |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0            | 30         | 49              |
| 31           | 60         | 24              |
| 61           | 90         | 34              |
| 91           | 120        | 35              |
| 121          | 150        | 42              |
| 151          | 180        | 36              |
| 181          | 210        | 26              |
| 211          | 240        | 4               |
| 241          | 270        | 5               |
| 271          | 300        | 1               |
| 301          | 330        | 1               |
| 331          | 360        | 1               |

### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
```TSQL
WITH nextPlan AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.start_date,
    p.plan_name,
    LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY p.plan_id) AS next_plan
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
)

SELECT COUNT(*) AS pro_to_basic_monthly
FROM nextPlan
WHERE plan_name = 'pro monthly'
  AND next_plan = 'basic monthly'
  AND YEAR(start_date) = 2020;
```
| pro_to_basic_monthly|
|---------------------|
| 0                   |

There were no customers downgrading from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020.

---

## C. Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
  * monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
  * upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
  * upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
  * once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:

| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | payment_date | amount | payment_order  |
|-------------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-08-08   | 9.90   | 1              |
